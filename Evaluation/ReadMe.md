Raw image and manual annottions are saved in ```.\RawImage``` and ```.\GorundTruth```, respectively. Complete dataset can be found [here](https://portland-my.sharepoint.com/:f:/g/personal/jfcao3-c_ad_cityu_edu_hk/EogQP1ha2H5Hm5Zly8_m92kBvHu9AWOvXb140Yj9Z_ef8A?e=4hVRlA), which provides you the all raw membrane image (t01-t95) and their segmentation results processed by 3DMMS.
